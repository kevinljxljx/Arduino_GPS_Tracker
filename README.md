# Arduino_GPS_Tracker

This project was created for an Arduino GPS tracking app. The idea was to have a GPS tracker in my car which sends data to adafruit.io. So later on I can use Google Map API to visualize those location data. 

The tracker was made with an arduino nano and a SIM808 modue.

You have to put in your Google Map API key, Adafruit.io AIO Key and the mqtt topic in order for it to work.
